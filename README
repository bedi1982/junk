It's all yours.

You find a lot of codes in C and C#, most academyc but I also wrote some for other training purposes, 
like a snake game, a words mixer code and a plugins installer for some Linux distros.
Plugins install app also received a interface, which i firstly started using raw GTK but later I found
out it would be easier using glade.

In C# there is a huge one for finantial control on pharmacy chain networks.

As I said, it's all yours if you find some utility for ir :)
