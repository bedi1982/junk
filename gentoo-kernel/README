Very good manual on how to install encrypted:
https://www.nkly.me/blog/2019/install-gentoo/

This kernel config is for notebook:
DELL Precision 5510

ALl notebook devices work;
virtualization qemu/libvirt fully works - build qemu with 'usbredir' use flag and libvirt with 'virt-network' use flag.

If you follow the blog encrypted install method dont forget to built the kernel with:
